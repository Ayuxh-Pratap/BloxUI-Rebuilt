<Steps>

### Information

BloxUI currently only support **React/Next**. This project and all components are written in **TypeScript / JavaScript**. We recommend using TypeScript for your project as well. But it's not required.

### Initialize BloxUI

run this npx command to Initialize bloxui in your directory

```bash copy title="terminal"
npx bloxui-comadd init
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```bash copy title="terminal"
? Do you want to initialize BloxUI in this directory? Y/n
```

After the prompts, `bloxui-comadd` will create a bloxui config file and will create the required file folders.

If you're new to BloxUI, see the project structure docs for an overview of all the possible files and folders in your application.

#### Once Completed âœ…
your terminal will look something like this;

<VideoSection
  width={700}
  height={600}
  className="w-full"
  alt="Git Authentication Settings"
  src="/init/blox-init.png"
/>

### Prerequisites

These are the main dependencies you will need to get started.

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss@latest clsx tailwind-merge framer-motion lucide-react
```

### Install components

That's it! Now you can go to any [component](/components) page and follow the instructions there

You only need to copy + paste the components you need! No bloat or third-party dependencies.
