### Information

BloxUI currently only support **React/Next**. This project and all components are written in **TypeScript**. We recommend using TypeScript for your project as well. But it's not required.

### Install components

That's it! Now you can go to any [component](/components) page and follow the instructions there

You only need to copy + paste the components you need! No bloat or third-party dependencies.
