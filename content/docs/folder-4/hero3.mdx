## Hero 3

GitButler can authenticate with an upstream Git server in several different ways.

 You can just tell us to use the system Git executable, which you can setup however you want. You can use our built in SSH protocol with either your own SSH key or a key we automatically generate for you (this does not require you to have Git installed), or you can use the default [Git credentials helper](https://git-scm.com/doc/credential-helpers).

You can set your preference (and test if it works) in your project's "Git authentication" section:

<ImageSection
  width={700}
  height={600}
  className="w-full"
  alt="Git Authentication Settings"
  src="/section/hero/hero2.png"
/>
